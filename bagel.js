WebGL rendererer is heavily based off of https://github.com/quidmonkey/particle_test

TODO:
== Testing ==
Rendering completely broken in Safari. Fine in firefox???

Moving textures back into combined automatically (and to I guess?)

Safari and firefox still have poor performance in full resolution loading screens

Should the loading screen use the full resolution? Need to commit to a set resolution otherwise. Dots are slightly off due to the resolution. Laggy in firefox

== Bugs ==
Nothing rendered for the first 2-3 frames? Not related to webgl initialising. Put debugger statement in main script to frame advance. Maybe flush needed??? Only applies to canvases?

Pause videos on state change

Cap alpha values during runtime, use an error?

Game flashes when resizing

Allow enabling antialiasing and switching renderers on the fly. Requires reinitialising the webgl context for both

= Features =
Copy canvas mode

Auto skip mode

Prerender function for canvases, runs when shown and when the resolution is changed

Remove initial delay logic and syntax

Asset preload, runs before init. Runs even when assets aren't being initialised. Sounds should preload their metadata and then wait until oncanplaythrough before they're considered loaded?

Reserve dot prefix for textures

Canvas renderer. Error for using texture debug methods when using it

touching.spriteSides and touching.gameSides sets last.collisionSide

Context lost handling

The ability to remove or replace a default argument for a sprite type. Maybe only for some? Prevent setting some attributes like "type"

Built in FPS counter

FPS stabilisation. Use the time elapsed to calcuate how many times to run the main code before rendering. 30hz displays would run the main code twice and then render and 120hz would run the code once then render but only on every other frame. Should Bagel.js attempt to catch up if it lags? Should frames be able to be dropped?

Display render options in Bagel.js console message. Antialiasing and fps stabilisation?

Dynamic resolution? Non chromium browsers benefit from lower resolutions because of the lower resolution textures?

Gamepad support


= Tweaks =
Update readme, Phaser is smaller than I thought? Even the version used in Frontier is fairly small (smaller than the current version), nowhere near 800KB???

Fix spelling errors

It's not important in the canvas renderer but in the WebGL renderer, the value determines how the texture is handled internally.\n\"auto\" will detect when you render to the canvas and update the texture after. This adds a slight overhead.\n\"static\" will assume the canvas won't be updated frequently but you can still update it by returning true from the function you set for your \"render\" argument.\nLastly \"animated\" will assume the canvas will be updated every frame, you can return true if you haven't though.\n\nFor all of these modes, Bagel.js can optimise differently depending on how you use it on a second by second basis. A the texture of even a static canvas can become a more memory intensive but faster to update single texture if it's updated on 3 consecutive frames (auto and animated become a single texture after 1). If any canvas isn't updated at all for a whole second, it'll become part of a combined texture to reduce memory usage. \"auto\" will also use a single texture if less than 80% of the total textures supported by the GPU are being used. Both \"auto\" and \"static\" canvases will be moved to a combined texture once updated if 90% of textures are being used or will be moved before an update if 100% of textures are full and a new WebGL texture is required.\nIn most circumstances, the \"mode\" argument only specifies the start point and in the case of \"auto\", how the renders will be detected."
