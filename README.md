# Bagel.js
A bread based JavaScript game framework

# Introduction
The main idea behind Bagel.js was to use objects and arrays to structure data and code. The idea being that it reduces repetition for commands such as creating a sprite. I worked on it on and off for about 2 years, racking up 11.7k lines of code.

Bagel.js is my most recent attempt at creating a games framework, out of 3 in total. Over these years I've discovered how difficult it is to make one well, but there have been major improvements between each one. I've paused this endeavour for now to focus on a wider variety of projects, but I might revisit it in the future if I get the ideas and time.

# Key features
 * Easy to learn, with little boilerplate code
 * Being JSON based structures the code
 * Robust input checking (for most things) with helpful errors
 * Plugins (some core stuff also uses a plugin)
 * A PWA creation tool ([example](http://hedgehog125.github.io/Bagel-PWA/))
 * Scales the resolution for any device while keeping the aspect ratio

Fun fact: it got its name because I used to get bagels at Coder Dojo Brighton before the university stopped doing them.
